My final project is a framework for other programs. it handles command line menu and a help command

to use it create static class with your program, then create a function and flag classes based off the provided template

the runNoFlag method should call the desired porgram while the flag classes should edit variables or change peramiters. 

to be clear the flag run methods are run before the runNoFlag method is run.

assuming you pass in the correct information the framework should build a much nicer interface, capable of handling multiple commands from the user.
